# How to contribute to Better Go Playground

## Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/x1unix/go-playground/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/x1unix/go-playground/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **shared code snippet** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change in the [Discussions](github.com/x1unix/go-playground/discussions) section and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

* Please see [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) for a project development guide.

* Ask any question about code structure in the [Discussions](github.com/x1unix/go-playground/discussions) section.

This project is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join [the team](https://github.com/x1unix/go-playground/graphs/contributors)!
